# Owl-Jumper
Owl Jumper is a visual and auditory simulation of Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia. It is initially represented as a retro-style platformer with allusions reminicant of popular titles such as the Super Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog franchises.

The project is heavily inspired by Leyland Kirby's 'Everywhere at the End of Time'; a series that explores dementia and it's impacts on the functionality of the human brain

It will be released as a free-to-play title on Steam, alongside an option to donate Steam wallet funds to international awareness campaigns.
