# Owl-Jumper
Owl Jumper is a visual and auditory simulation of the cognitive decay associated with alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia. It is initially disguised as a cheery platformer with graphical allusions reminicant of popular titles such as Super Mario Bros.

The project is also heavily inspired by Leyland Kirby's 'Everywhere at the End of Time'; a series that explores dementia and it's impacts on the human brain.

It will be released as a free-to-play title on Steam, with an option to donate Steam wallet funds to international awareness campaigns.
