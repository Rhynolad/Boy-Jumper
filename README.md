# Max-Jumper
Max Jumper is a visual and auditory simulation of the cognitive decay associated with alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia. It is initially disguised as a cheery platformer with graphical allusions reminicant of popular titles such as Super Mario Bros and The Legend of Zelda. 

The project is also heavily inspired by Leyland Kirby's 'Everywhere at the End of Time'; a series that explores dementia and it's impacts on the human brain.

It will be released as a free-to-play title on Steam. There will also be an option to donate Steam wallet funds, which will go toward international research co-operations and awareness campaigns for the condition.
