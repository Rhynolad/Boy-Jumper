# Max-Jumper
Max Jumper is a visual and auditory simulation of the cognitive decay associated with alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia. It is initially disguised as a cheery platformer with graphical allusions reminicant of popular titles for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It is also heavily inspired by Leyland Kirby's 'Everywhere at the End of Time'.
