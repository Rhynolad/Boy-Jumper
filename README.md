# Owl-Jumper
Owl Jumper is a visual and auditory simulation of Alzheimer's disease, the most common variant of Dementia. It is initially represented as a retro-style platformer, reminicant of popular titles such as the Super Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog franchises.

The project is heavily inspired by Leyland Kirby's 'Everywhere at the End of Time'; a series of albums that explore dementia and it's impacts on the function of the human brain.

It will be released as a free-to-play title on Steam, with an option to donate Steam wallet funds to international awareness campaigns.
